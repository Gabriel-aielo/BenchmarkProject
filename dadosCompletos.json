Azul el Martes 7 de marzo 2023 a la firma Casabo  el motivo de la visita fue escuchar en persona y ver insitu el reclamo que ellos recibieron de su cliente por los estuches que le fabricaron de Maní con Chocolate marca Hass. El cliente les reclama que tuvieron que levantar del mercado 700.000 estuches por estar la gran mayoría despegados en la costura lateral. Esto ocurrió en plena temporada en la campaña navideña con los agravantes que esto trajo  desprestigio pérdidas de ventas que no se realizaron. Lo que se observa es que el adhesivo al tiempo estando el producto en góndola se abre al medio produciendo lo que se conoce como falla adhesiva ya que queda producto de ambos lados con el tack suficiente como para volver a juntarse pero a las horas se despega nuevamente. En un principio Casabo reclama unos 14.500 USD que es el costo que ellos tuvieron que invertir para producir nuevamente estuches con otro adhesivo provisto por Henkel y luego continuaron con el que Cia. Azul entrego procedente de Brasil tras un embarque vía aérea que fue recomendado por Nosotros y que funciona sin ningún inconveniente ( CQ 4163/1 ). Pero están a la espera de que si su cliente no los demanda por daños y perjuicios. El cliente paso un monto de dinero que Fuller debe retribuir para compensar los gastos extras que le ocasionó tener que retirar del mercado todos los estuches con producto en su interior y volver a enviar estuches buenos para salir nuevamente al mercado SO: 30765916 Cantidad: 240 kg Lote: 0001269826 Material: 15008325 2106LA PI BX 12.00 KG Factura #: 0015-00001390 (900839950) ","Reported Date & Time":"","Submitted By":"Johanna Villalobos ","Submitted By SSO":"Johanna.Villalobos@hbfuller.com ","Core Activity":"","Corrective Action and Follow-Up":"Action Finding pending (if applicable)\nClosed  ","Dispute Amount":"145.000.000","Associated NONs?":"No","Immediate Response":"","Closure Date":"19/09/2023","Follow-Up Status":"Closed","Incident Time":"11:09 AM","Update By":"Michelle Scalabrin ","Update Date":"04/10/2023","Date Recorded":"07/08/2023","Full Customer Name":"COMPANIA AZUL S.A.","HBF Order Number":"30765916","Unit":"","Invoice Number":"900839950","Material of Concern":"","Process Order":"","Product Compliance":"","Purchase Order":"","Containment Action":"","Line Item":"","Credit for Return":"","Credit for Return Amount":"","Material":"","Effective Approver":"","Customer Material":"","Repeat Comments":"","Date of Loss (install date or date of injury)":"","Settlement Amount (in USD)":"","Settlement Pay Method (cash payment or product credit)":"","Reserve (amount we have booked as an estimate to settle)":"","Expenses Paid (payments made to a third party such as legal fees associated with the claim)":"","All customer expectations have been complete":"Yes","Investigation Complete Date":"28-Sep-2023","Comments":"","Tableau Report":"","Defect Location":"Facility Related - Quality","Extra Cost (Local)":"","Extra Cost Description":"","Credit Info Completed":"","Credit Info Completed Date":"","CC Team Assigned":"","Credit Info Comments":"","Workflow Stage":"Complete","Extra Cost (USD)":"","FM Approver Setter":"","QM Approver Setter":"","SOP Approver Setter":"","AM Approver Setter":"","Market Leader Approver Setter":"","FM Approval Setter":"","QM Approval Setter":"","SOP Approval Setter":"","AM Approval Setter":"","Market Leader Approval Setter":"","Preliminary Analysis":"","Risk Description":"falla del producto","Associated Inspection":"","Associated Actions":"None ","Unnamed: 74":"","Unnamed: 75":"","Unnamed: 76":"","Unnamed: 77":"","Unnamed: 78":"","Unnamed: 79":"","Unnamed: 80":"","Unnamed: 81":"","Unnamed: 82":"","Unnamed: 83":"","Unnamed: 84":"","Unnamed: 85":"","Unnamed: 86":"","Associated 5-Why Actions":"None ","Illness/Injury":"No ","Safety Risk Assessment (JSA) ID/Title":"","Investigation Start Date":"07/08/2023","Investigation Leader":"","Investigation Team":"","Submitted By.1":"Johanna Villalobos","Cause Location":"","Cause Code":"","Job Factor":""},{"Organization":"LA","Sub-Organization":"HHC","Site":"Pilar  Argentina","ID":"7182 ","Remote ID":"","Date":"07/08/2023","Type":"Customer Complaint\n ","Category":"Product/Quality","SubSite":"","Dept":"CS - Customer Service","Sub-Dept":"\n ","Description":"El motivo del rechazo se debe a problemas de calidad y maquinabilidad que se observaron con la utilización del adhesivo  además de generar olores desagradables en el área.

hagamos cargo de los gastos extras que tuvo por tener que re imprimir 5 títulos de libros que produjo a una editorial y que se los regresaron por estar mal encuadernados. El gasto extra en el que incurrió el cliente fue de 644.000 ARS entre papel  tinta  adhesivo y hora hombre que a ese momento correspondían de 280 kilos de producto. Si bien en el informe de los ensayos de Page Flex y Page Pull se corroboró que los libros estaban mal encuadernados  no se pudo determinar que el causante del problema haya sido la calidad del adhesivo sino su aplicación. Si bien esto quedó aclarado con el cliente y con ADHESINT y se dejó constancia por escrito en un informe entregado  como existe una zona gris difícil de corroborar de porque se aplicó mal  ADHESINT resolvió entonces compensar al cliente con 280 kilos gratis de producto ya que el cliente había dejado de comprarle producto (1000 kilos mes)  porque el cliente consideraba que el causante de la mala aplicación fue el adhesivo. Nosotros acordamos que acompañaremos a ADHESINT invirtiendo el 50% de este monto exclusivamente por razones comerciales.

Every 3 months the index is reviewed and new prices are determined. Unfortunately  Jonathan did not communicate to us in time that there were new prices as of July 1st and this has caused Mexico and Colombia to have a difference in price from July 1st to date. Yesterday  Mondi Mexico requested us  also Mondi Mexico was not aware of these new prices; to generate NC for the difference in price from July to date. The difference is $0.31 usd/kg  so the amounts of these NC (1 per plant  3 in Mexico) are considerable. The NC should be made for value because commercial did not know about the price decrease so the changes had not been made in the flip system. The changes were already in place. The amount is $ 14 552.38 this does not include VAT. ","Reported Date & Time":"","Submitted By":"Joseline Calderon ","Submitted By SSO":"Joseline.Calderon@hbfuller.com ","Core Activity":"","Corrective Action and Follow-Up":"Action Finding pending (if applicable)\nClosed  ","Dispute Amount":"0.0000","Associated NONs?":"No","Immediate Response":"","Closure Date":"17/11/2023","Follow-Up Status":"Closed","Incident Time":"","Update By":"Karina Nakacim ","Update Date":"22/11/2023","Date Recorded":"17/11/2023","Full Customer Name":"MONDI MEXICO MONTERREY","HBF Order Number":"31067540","Unit":"IBC","Invoice Number":"901389193","Material of Concern":"","Process Order":"","Product Compliance":"","Purchase Order":"","Containment Action":"","Line Item":"","Credit for Return":"","Credit for Return Amount":"","Material":"","Effective Approver":"","Customer Material":"","Repeat Comments":"","Date of Loss (install date or date of injury)":"","Settlement Amount (in USD)":"","Settlement Pay Method (cash payment or product credit)":"","Reserve (amount we have booked as an estimate to settle)":"","Expenses Paid (payments made to a third party such as legal fees associated with the claim)":"","All customer expectations have been complete":"Yes","Investigation Complete Date":"17/nov/23","Comments":"","Tableau Report":"","Defect Location":"Sales Related","Extra Cost (Local)":"","Extra Cost Description":"","Credit Info Completed":"","Credit Info Completed Date":"","CC Team Assigned":"","Credit Info Comments":"","Workflow Stage":"Complete","Extra Cost (USD)":"","FM Approver Setter":"Joseline Calderon","QM Approver Setter":"","SOP Approver Setter":"","AM Approver Setter":"","Market Leader Approver Setter":"","FM Approval Setter":"Gabriela Lopez  2023-11-17","QM Approval Setter":"","SOP Approval Setter":"","AM Approval Setter":"","Market Leader Approval Setter":"","Preliminary Analysis":"","Risk Description":"","Associated Inspection":"","Associated Actions":"None ","Unnamed: 74":"","Unnamed: 75":"","Unnamed: 76":"","Unnamed: 77":"","Unnamed: 78":"","Unnamed: 79":"","Unnamed: 80":"","Unnamed: 81":"","Unnamed: 82":"","Unnamed: 83":"","Unnamed: 84":"","Unnamed: 85":"","Unnamed: 86":"","Associated 5-Why Actions":"None ","Illness/Injury":"No ","Safety Risk Assessment (JSA) ID/Title":"","Investigation Start Date":"17/11/2023","Investigation Leader":"","Investigation Team":"","Submitted By.1":"Joseline Calderon","Cause Location":"","Cause Code":"","Job Factor":""},{"Organization":"LA","Sub-Organization":"HHC","Site":"Mexico Mgmt","ID":"10230 ","Remote ID":"","Date":"17/11/2023","Type":"Customer Complaint\n ","Category":"Pricing/Payment","SubSite":"","Dept":"Sales","Sub-Dept":"\n ","Description":"El negocio de Mondi se maneja entre ambos corporativos  antes lo hacía Kenneth Ledford  ahora lo hace Jonathan Manterfield.

A suspeita é de que seja o produto CQ-7512 ou CQ-7140  porém não é possível identificar por ser produtos parecidos  portanto a fim de evitar que seja enviado ao cliente produto errado será realizado devolução e reposição para a Supply. OBS: A Supply colou uma etiqueta com identificação do produto CQ-7512 para envio ao cliente . O produto se encontra na transportadora  porém a Supply irá solicitar a devolução do produto e irá retirar a etiqueta o que pode deixar as caixas marcadas . The Supply customer received two unmarked boxes on the pallet. The suspicion is that it is the product CQ-7512 or CQ-7140  but it is not possible to identify them because they are similar products  so in order to avoid that the wrong product is sent to the customer  a return and replacement will be made to Supply. PS: Supply has attached a label with product identification CQ-7512 for shipment to the customer. The product is in the carrier  but Supply will request the return of the product and will remove the label which may leave the boxes marked. ","Reported Date & Time":"","Submitted By":"Thamires Marcelino ","Submitted By SSO":"thamires.marcelino@hbfuller.com ","Core Activity":"","Corrective Action and Follow-Up":"Action Finding pending (if applicable)\nClosed  ","Dispute Amount":"1.986.700","Associated NONs?":"No","Immediate Response":"","Closure Date":"30/11/2023","Follow-Up Status":"Closed","Incident Time":"","Update By":"Thamires Marcelino ","Update Date":"08/02/2024","Date Recorded":"21/11/2023","Full Customer Name":"SUPPLY COMPANY COM E REP COMERCIAIS DE PRODUCOES","HBF Order Number":"149247","Unit":"","Invoice Number":"53012","Material of Concern":"","Process Order":"","Product Compliance":"","Purchase Order":"","Containment Action":"","Line Item":"","Credit for Return":"","Credit for Return Amount":"","Material":"","Effective Approver":"","Customer Material":"Resource Number: 16001869\nMaterial Description: CQ-7512 PI CAI 15.00 KG\n\n","Repeat Comments":"","Date of Loss (install date or date of injury)":"","Settlement Amount (in USD)":"","Settlement Pay Method (cash payment or product credit)":"","Reserve (amount we have booked as an estimate to settle)":"","Expenses Paid (payments made to a third party such as legal fees associated with the claim)":"","All customer expectations have been complete":"","Investigation Complete Date":"30/nov/23","Comments":"Ações realizadas no ID 9638 https://hbfuller.benchmarkdigital.com/home/index.cfm#/HBFuller/qlty/audit/audfinding.cfm?status=Closed&org=3&loc=Guarulhos%2C+Brazil&factoryid=&id=328","Tableau Report":"","Defect Location":"Facility Related – Plant Shipping","Extra Cost (Local)":"","Extra Cost Description":"","Credit Info Completed":"","Credit Info Completed Date":"","CC Team Assigned":"","Credit Info Comments":"","Workflow Stage":"Complete","Extra Cost (USD)":"","FM Approver Setter":"","QM Approver Setter":"Thamires Marcelino","SOP Approver Setter":"","AM Approver Setter":"","Market Leader Approver Setter":"","FM Approval Setter":"","QM Approval Setter":"Michelle Scalabrin  2023-11-21","SOP Approval Setter":"","AM Approval Setter":"","Market Leader Approval Setter":"","Preliminary Analysis":"","Risk Description":"Produto sem identificação","Associated Inspection":"","Associated Actions":"None ","Unnamed: 74":"","Unnamed: 75":"","Unnamed: 76":"","Unnamed: 77":"","Unnamed: 78":"","Unnamed: 79":"","Unnamed: 80":"","Unnamed: 81":"","Unnamed: 82":"","Unnamed: 83":"","Unnamed: 84":"","Unnamed: 85":"","Unnamed: 86":"","Associated 5-Why Actions":"None ","Illness/Injury":"No ","Safety Risk Assessment (JSA) ID/Title":"","Investigation Start Date":"23/11/2023","Investigation Leader":"Vanessa Pereira","Investigation Team":"Leticia.Guerra@hbfuller.com","Submitted By.1":"Thamires Marcelino","Cause Location":"Production \n\n","Cause Code":"Man - miss inspection \n\n","Job Factor":"Operational Discipline (OD) \n\n"},{"Organization":"LA","Sub-Organization":"HHC","Site":"Guarulhos  Brazil","ID":"10328 ","Remote ID":"","Date":"21/11/2023","Type":"Internal Concerns\n ","Category":"Packaging Related","SubSite":"","Dept":"Customer Care","Sub-Dept":"\n ","Description":"3 clientes reclamaram que as caixas estão chegando abertas.

Os lotes ainda apresentam um problema de derretimento inicial  para abastecer o coleiro  o mesmo atinge até 190°C retornando ao normal posteriormente  ocasionando ressecamento na parte superior dos coleiros. ************************** Material: CQ-645PUR Lots: 200.061743 and 200.062044 Quantity: 1200kg Reason: Several glue sticks are larger in diameter and height than the collar  making it impossible to fit them in. They also have aluminum adhered to them. The batches also have a problem with initial melting  when the glue sticks are filled  which reaches up to 190°C and then returns to normal  causing the tops of the glue sticks to dry out. ","Reported

Fueron alrededor de 4-5 cajas reportadas al momento de nuestra visita  sin embargo  consideran que hay más cajas en este estado.
